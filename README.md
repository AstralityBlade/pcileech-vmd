# pcileech-vmd
FPGA card looks like an Intel VMD Controller, but hides inside pcileech-fpga researching tool.
# Usage
This firmware was created for researching purposes only.
# Original project by ekknod based on Ulf Frisk pcileech-fpga project
Original project can be found from https://github.com/ekknod/pcileech-wifi
# Notice
- Project might contain some errors, so please dont blame me for it
- This project is released only because a lot of people are still selling this project for an extremely high amount, despite the fact that the bin files have been in the public domain for a long time. Well, and because all sorts of Chinese “geniuses” post all sorts of incomplete sources in the hope of getting users on the server, when the source code has long been walking around the Chinese chat rooms
